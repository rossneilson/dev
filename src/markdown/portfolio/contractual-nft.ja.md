Won the Polygon-matic NFT prize at Gitcoin 0xHack Hackthon

An ERC-721 that allows multiple artists to create an agreement. Then once the art (music/image/etc) is complete all members can approve and an NFT will be minted for each member of the agreement. 

If there is a dispute then the claim can be taken to a community governance vote based on the final product and the agreement made in the beginning. Can also allow for payment to other addresses on completion.
